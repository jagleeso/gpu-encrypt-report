issues with device restart
- disabling OpenGL
  - tried kernel flags (MSM_KSGL)
    - any flags that disabled OpenGL also disabled OpenCL
  - resorted to removing OpenGL shared libraries
    - resulted in android processes not starting (good)
    - still ran into issues with device restart on long running kernels
      - tried several different OpenCL kernels, to see if GPU hang detection does something obvious (e.g. hang is determined by memory accesses not changing)
        - flip entire output buffer between '1' and '2', and read entire input buffer
