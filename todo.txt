- measure copy time (CPU to GPU)
  - explain difference when reusing buffer
- see if we can find SSLShader CUDA code for AES encryption/decryption
- how can we figure out if the CPU and GPU are sharing memory?
  - READ DOCS I FOUND
  - can we email qualcomm for more information on GPU specifications?
    - SIMD width
    - shared memory or not (i.e. can we encrypt memory in place...?)
      - check OpenCL specification
- IF they share memory, can we avoid a CPU to GPU copy (GPU has it's own MMU...? Can we map addresses manually?) ?
- email eyal about next steps (am i on the right track?)
- ask about things to read / upcoming long term goals
- print slides for 2502
- review things in text mentioned in lecture notes / review notes
