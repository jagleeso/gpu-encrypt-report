- measure copy time (CPU to GPU)
  - explain difference when reusing buffer
  - cross-compile install lmbench
    - use it to determine gettimeofday clock resolution
    - maybe use it for timing measurements
    - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11852187/how-to-compile-gcc-for-android
- see if we can find SSLShader CUDA code for AES encryption/decryption
- how can we figure out if the CPU and GPU are sharing memory?
  - READ DOCS I FOUND
  - can we email qualcomm for more information on GPU specifications?
    - SIMD width
    - shared memory or not (i.e. can we encrypt memory in place...?)
      - check OpenCL specification
- IF they share memory, can we avoid a CPU to GPU copy (GPU has it's own MMU...? Can we map addresses manually?) ?
- email eyal about next steps (am i on the right track?)
- ask about things to read / upcoming long term goals
- print slides for 2502
- review things in text mentioned in lecture notes / review notes

- me:
  - cross-compile gdb for android for less insanity
