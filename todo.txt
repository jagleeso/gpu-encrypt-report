- measure throughput of (multithreaded?) software AES implementation
  - graph against OpenCL implementation
- measure energy usage of software AES implementation

- compile methodology / experimental results for report
  - gather clinfo data (make a table of important bits)
    - max work group size
    - AES kernel max work group size
    - device memory
  - gather other device info
    - Motox model name
    - chipset
    - GPU, speed, cores
    - CPU, speed, cores

  - explain graphs (use reports)
  - expand on encryption throughput graph

  - just do it in word, compile into report later
  - convert to slides
